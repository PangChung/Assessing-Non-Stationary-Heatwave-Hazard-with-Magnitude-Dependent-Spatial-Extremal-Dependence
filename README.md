# Assessing-Non-Stationary-Heatwave-Hazard-with-Magnitude-Dependent-Spatial-Extremal-Dependence
It contains the code for a toy example and the data used in our paper "Assessing Non-Stationary Heatwave Hazard with Magnitude-Dependent Spatial Extremal Dependence".

The original data are public available from https://www.ecad.eu//dailydata/predefinedseries.php, which contains daily maximum temperature recored over 20,000 monitor stations across Europe. We selected 44 of them. 

To reproduce the results, you can load the data.Rdata file and replace the corresponding variables in the example.R. It might take a fair long time to run.
